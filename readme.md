Grant Dahlhauser's Mancala Project

The Mancala project was made with html, css, javascript, and jQuery and was edited in Atom.  

The approach I took to coding this site was to start with the basics and work my way up.  I started with just one container then spread that functionality to the other squares making some minor adjustments.

There is no installation needed, just simply visit this site!

A few of my unsolved stretch goals would be centering the numbers in the divs, and adding optional extra rules.
