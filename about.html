    <h1>About Mancala</h1>
    <p><a href='index.html'>Back to Game</a></p>
    <p>Mancala is a turn based board game where each player is trying to move stones or seeds from the board into their mancala. (the long goal on each end of the board)  <br>
    During a turn the player picks a hole and takes out all of the stones, then places one stone in each subsiquent hole until there are no more stones left to place.  <br>
    If during your turn your last stone is dropped into your mancala then you get another turn <br>
    When there are no more stones on the board the game is over and whoever has the most in their mancala is the winner! </p>
